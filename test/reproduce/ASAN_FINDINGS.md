# Address Sanitizer (ASAN) Findings for RSA X931 Signature Verification Issue

## Summary

The RSA X931 signature verification issue in wolfProvider was tested with Address Sanitizer (ASAN) enabled to detect potential memory-related issues or undefined behavior. Multiple test cases were created and run with comprehensive ASAN options.

## ASAN Configuration

The following ASAN options were used for thorough error detection:
```
ASAN_OPTIONS="detect_leaks=1:detect_stack_use_after_return=1:check_initialization_order=1:strict_init_order=1:detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=2:detect_container_overflow=1:strict_string_checks=1:halt_on_error=0:print_stacktrace=1:fast_unwind_on_malloc=0:malloc_context_size=30:symbolize=1:detect_odr_violation=0"
```

## Test Results

After running multiple test cases with ASAN enabled, **no memory-related issues were detected** that could explain the intermittent RSA X931 signature verification failures. The tests consistently showed the same error pattern:

```
error:02000089:rsa routines::invalid header
error:02000072:rsa routines::padding check failed
error:1C880004:Provider routines::RSA lib
```

These errors indicate issues with the X931 padding implementation rather than memory corruption or undefined behavior.

## Key Findings

1. **No Memory Corruption**: ASAN did not detect any memory corruption, buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory-related issues.

2. **No Undefined Behavior**: No undefined behavior was detected in the RSA X931 signature verification code.

3. **Consistent Failure Pattern**: The failures were consistent and related to the padding implementation rather than memory issues.

4. **Provider Initialization Issues**: When testing with wolfProvider and ASAN, there were some provider initialization issues, but these were not directly related to the X931 signature verification failure.

## Conclusion

The RSA X931 signature verification issue is not caused by memory corruption or undefined behavior. The issue appears to be in the X931 padding implementation logic, particularly in how wolfProvider formats and verifies the X931 padding compared to OpenSSL's expectations.

The focus of further investigation should be on the padding implementation in `wp_rsa_verify_x931` and `wp_remove_x931_padding` functions, especially the handling of the RSA modulus and the X931 padding format.
